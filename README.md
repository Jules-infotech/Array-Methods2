##Array Manipulation Methods in JavaScript

This document provides a quick overview of some of the most useful JavaScript array methods for manipulating data. These methods can help you to efficiently process, transform, and extract information from arrays.

##   Essential Methods

###   every()
// Is everyone 19 or older?

###  find()

*Find is like filter(), but instead returns just the one you are looking for
// find the comment with the ID of 823423

### findIndex()

 // Find the comment with this ID
// delete the comment with the ID of 823423

    
There are many other useful array methods, including:

* `concat()`:  Joins two or more arrays.
* `slice()`: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
* `splice()`: Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
* `includes()`: Determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries.
* `indexOf()`:  Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
* `push()`: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
* `pop()`: Removes the last element from an array.
* `shift()`: Removes the first element from an array.
* `unshift()`: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
